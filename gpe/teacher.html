        <h2> teacher area:</h2>
        <p >
            teacher area will contain for now two main things
            it will be accessed by username and password. 
            <ol>
                <li> the build icon which enable to redirect to the dashboard to create a test</li>
                <li> grades icon which redirect to the grades test which enable to access tests grades</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>grade</h3>
            <p>
                in grade icon it will appear all tests that's was created. <br>
                two options available for teacher grade area filter and sort <br>
                filter by exam id and sort by grades. <br>
                answered exam can be previewd to be on pop-up screen as format with the system grades. <br>
                later we are looking to that teacher can edit grades also grad sent to the student. <br>
                in this case student will have an intital grade wich is AI grad and final grad which is Teacher grade.
                </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>dashboard</h3>
            <p> after or before exame building teacher will able to add:
                <ul>
                    <li>Title </li>
                    <li>Time </li>
                    <li>additional Rules</li>
                </ul>
                student can't take exame before accept.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                the dashboard which will enable teacher to creat a formate of exame. <br>
                will have a cool view and can add questions. different types of questions. <br>
                in dashboard teacher write the question with answer. it will be stored on type of Key and value. <br>
                the goal is trying to assign all the exam on such way with lowest number of process. <br>
                "Q1,1", "Q1,2" ........ "Q6,2", etc. <br>
                and this will be stored in such CSV file. <br>
                the main reason behind that is the answer can be assigned to more than one value. <br>
                next is when data is passed from students it will work as dictionry will be faster. <br>
                the other concept is Question not important at all for us, the main value is the answer. <br>
                chaleng to be reviewed: <br>
                how to store non nominal in CSV such as if we included picture.

                <h4> types of questions on dashborad to be add: </h4>
